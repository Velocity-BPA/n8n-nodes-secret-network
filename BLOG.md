# Automate Secret Network with n8n: Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts Made Simple

We're excited to announce the launch of n8n-nodes-secret-network, a powerful new community node that brings Secret Network's privacy-preserving blockchain capabilities directly into your n8n workflows.

## The Privacy Problem in Blockchain Automation

While blockchain technology has revolutionized transparency, many business applications require confidentiality. Secret Network solves this with encrypted smart contracts, but integrating these privacy features into automated workflows has traditionally required extensive blockchain development expertise.

That's where our new n8n node comes in.

## What Makes This Node Special

The n8n-nodes-secret-network integration enables you to:

- **Execute Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts**: Interact with Secret Network's encrypted smart contracts directly from your n8n workflows
- **Manage SNIP-20 Tokens**: Automate private token transfers and balance checks with Secret Network's fungible token standard
- **Handle SNIP-721 NFTs**: Integrate private NFT operations into your automation workflows
- **Leverage IBC Functionality**: Connect Secret Network with other Cosmos-based blockchains through Inter-Blockchain Communication
- **No-Code Blockchain Integration**: Build complex blockchain automations without writing a single line of Solidity or Rust

## Real-World Use Cases

Imagine automating confidential payment processing, creating private NFT minting workflows triggered by CRM events, or building cross-chain automation that respects user privacy. With this node, these scenarios become accessible to no-code builders and developers alike.

## Getting Started

Installing the Secret Network node is straightforward. In your n8n instance, run:


npm install n8n-nodes-secret-network


After installation, restart n8n, and you'll find the Secret Network node available in your node palette.

The node integrates seamlessly with your existing n8n workflows, allowing you to combine Secret Network operations with hundreds of other services and applications.

## Open Source and Community-Driven

This node is fully open source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/Velocity-BPA/n8n-nodes-secret-network. We welcome contributions, feature requests, and bug reports from the community.
